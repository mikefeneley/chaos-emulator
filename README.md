# chaos-emulator

This is a skeleton repository. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap:</b>

Want to implement an emulator tool that can detect the type of file input and then run the corresponding emulation software.

Design will be such that the user can specify which emulators he wants to use with the tool. They should be modular so that corresponding emulator modules can be plugged in to the code to support more or less platforms depending upon the needs of the user.
